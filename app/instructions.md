Welcome! In this test, you'll be creating a React app similar to the example found here: https://lnw3ng.csb.app/

Let's get started!

Instructions:

1. Create the layout (do not focus on styles yet).
2. Populate the list of beers using the provided JSON file.
3. Create a function to filter the list of beers based on the search input.
4. Replace the local beers.json by calling the API at https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers. Refer to the documentation at https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2 for guidance.
5. Apply styles to the layout.
6. Create a modal to display the details of the beer. Consider using the react-modal package available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-modal.
7. Extract the functionality into a custom hook.
8. Add a debounce feature to the search input. You can find an example at https://usehooks.com/usedebounce

Good luck!
